approach the player to deal contact damage.

"Swingers" are like waddlers, but they have actual
attack animations and swing at the player.

"Turrets" don't shoot projectiles, but they have
don't move and have long range damage fields
when they attack, kinda like a turret.

"Floaters" fly towards the player and spin around
